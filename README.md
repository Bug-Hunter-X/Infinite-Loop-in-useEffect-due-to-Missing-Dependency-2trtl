This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by a missing dependency in the `useEffect` hook. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from the `setInterval` function not being cleaned up properly, leading to repeated updates and an infinite render cycle. The solution adds the `count` variable to the dependency array, ensuring the effect runs only when the count changes and resolves the loop.
